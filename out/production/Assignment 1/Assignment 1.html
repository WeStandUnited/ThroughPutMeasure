    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>

    Measure the latency and throughput of TCP and/or UDP (as noted
    below) across at least three pairs of machines using at least two
    different networks. For example, two CS servers (like wolf and
    pi), or a CS server to a laptop, wired or wireless, or off-campus.
    Create a web page with graphs summarizing your results. All
    messages must use xor encoding of 64bit (8 byte) values, based on
    a (possibly random) key.  Include the following measurements:

    <ul>
      <li> Measure round-trip latency as a function of message size,
        by sending and receiving (echoing and validating) messages of
        size 8, 64, and 1024 bytes, using TCP. Measure RTTs.

      </li><li> The same as (1), except using UDP.

      </li><li> Measure throughput by sending TCP messages of size 1K, 16K,
        64K, 256K, and 1M bytes in each direction. Measure transfer
        rates.

      </li><li> Measure the interaction between message size and number of
        messages using TCP and UDP by sending 1MByte of data (with a
        8-byte acknowledgment in the reverse direction) using
        different numbers of messages: 1024 1024Byte messages, vs 2048
        512Byte messages, vs 4096 X 256Byte messages.

      </li><li> The same as (4), using UDP.
        
    </li></ul>

    For timing, use System.nanoTime (or the closest equivalent if
    using other languages). Read through the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/index.html">
    Java networking tutorial</a>. Also see <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/csc445/SimpleService.java">
    SimpleService.java</a> and <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/csc445/EchoClient.java">EchoClient.java</a>
    for some stripped-down examples of using server and client sockets.
    When using non-CS machines and networks, minimize unnecessary
    traffic while developing your programs. Beware of firewalls.
